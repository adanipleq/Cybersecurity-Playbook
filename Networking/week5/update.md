mindtap not wanting to work lol. logged in and out like four times and it frustratingly gave me the same message. 


**3 key terms:**

1: OSI model- the OSI model is conceptual framework created by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into seven layers.

2: TCP/IP model- the TCP/IP model is a foundational protocol suite that defines how data is transmitted across the internet and other computer networks, ensuring communication between different devices and systems.

3: DHCP Client- a device or application on a network that uses the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) to automatically request and receive network configuration information, primarily an IP address, from a DHCP server.

Applied example: An applied example from the content I learned this week is: using the OSI model to troubleshoot and document an issue. There are three common ways to use the OSI model. You can start from the bottom layer of the OSI model and work your way up, start from the top and work your way down, or you can Divide and Conquer; where you start at a layer you suspect is the cause and proceed up or down as needed.

**Deliverables:** Summary of TCP vs UDP differences, Screenshot/notes from Lab B (VM Lab 4 or 5).

## TCP vs UDP: 

**TCP:** Transmission Control Protocol, is a core internet protocol that provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked data transmission between applications over a network. It works with the Internet Protocol (IP) to manage data delivery, breaking large messages into smaller data segments, assigning sequence numbers to ensure they arrive in the correct order, and using acknowledgments to confirm successful receipt and recover lost segments. TCP establishes and maintains a reliable connection using a process called a three-way handshake, ensuring data flows correctly from sender to receiver. 

**UDP:** User Datagram Protocol, a connectionless and unreliable communication protocol used on the internet for time-sensitive applications where speed is more important than guaranteed delivery of every packet. It enables quick data transfer by sending packets without establishing a prior connection, making it ideal for online gaming, video streaming, and voice calls, even if some data is lost.
