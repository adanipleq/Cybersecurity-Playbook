# When to use star vs. mesh topology
**When to use star topology:** Used with smaller networks (such as a home network), easy and cost effective to use, devices are all connected via centralized hub, allowing easy management and isolation of faults.

**When to use mesh topology:** Used with larger networks (an office, for example), decentralized paths, greater reliability and load spreading, suitable for large critical systems.

# Key differences between switches and routers
Switches:
Connects devices within the same network, using MAC addresses.
Routers:
Acts as a traffic director by assigning IP addresses and managing data flow between them.
