## üåç OSI Model (7 Layers)
Mnemonic: **Please Do Not Throw Sausage Pizza Away** (top ‚Üí bottom)

| Layer | Purpose | Example Protocols |
|-------|---------|-------------------|
| Application (7) | User applications | HTTP, FTP, DNS, SMTP |
| Presentation (6) | Data format, encryption | TLS, JPEG |
| Session (5) | Session management | NetBIOS, RPC |
| Transport (4) | Reliable delivery | TCP, UDP |
| Network (3) | Logical addressing & routing | IP, ICMP |
| Data Link (2) | Framing, MAC addressing | Ethernet, ARP |
| Physical (1) | Transmission of bits | Cables, fiber, radio |

## üåê TCP/IP Model (4 Layers)
Mnemonic: **All Teachers Need Pizza**

| Layer | Purpose | Example Protocols |
|-------|---------|-------------------|
| Application | User apps & data | HTTP, FTP, DNS, SMTP, SSH |
| Transport | End-to-end delivery | TCP, UDP |
| Internet | Logical addressing & routing | IP, ICMP, ARP |
| Network Access (Link) | Physical delivery | Ethernet, Wi-Fi |

## ‚ö° OSI vs TCP/IP Comparison

| Feature | OSI (7 Layers) | TCP/IP (4 Layers) |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| Layer Count | 7 | 4 |
| Presentation & Session | Separate | Merged into Application |
| Data Link & Physical | Separate | Merged into Link layer |
| Usage | Theoretical, teaching | Practical, internet standard |

## üìú Standards Bodies
- **IEEE** ‚Äì Ethernet, Wi-Fi (802 standards)  
- **IETF** ‚Äì Internet protocols (TCP/IP, RFCs)  
- **ISO** ‚Äì International standards, OSI model  
- **ANSI** ‚Äì US standards  
- **ITU** ‚Äì Telecom & global networking

## üìù Module 7 Assignments
- **MindTap Labs** ‚Äì Practice OSI vs TCP/IP mapping.  
- **Playbook Task** ‚Äì Create OSI vs TCP/IP comparison chart.  
- **Reflection** ‚Äì Write on why layered models are important for troubleshooting.

## üéØ Certification Alignment (CCST Networking)
- Explain OSI vs TCP/IP models.  
- Identify functions of each layer.  
- Map common protocols (HTTP, FTP, TCP, UDP, IP, ARP, DNS, ICMP) to correct layers.

‚úçÔ∏è **Study Tip:**  
Draw the OSI stack on one side of a page and the TCP/IP stack on the other. Then practice mapping protocols between them!
