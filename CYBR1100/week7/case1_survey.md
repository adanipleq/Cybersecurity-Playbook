# Case Project 6-1: Survey about Privacy

**Survey**
1.	Do you know what location services are?
   
   RESPONSE FROM PEER:
   
“Tracking.”

The person I interviewed is aware of location services and how they are used. They didn't give me very descriptive and lengthy answer but "tracking" shows that they are aware that their device can be tracked using location services.

3.	What is RAID?

  	 RESPONSE FROM PEER:

“RAID 0, RAID 1, RAID 10. Striping and mirroring.”

My classmate is aware of RAID, but didn't give me a very specific definition. They know about different types of RAID and what they are used for.


3.Are you aware of survaillence based advertisers?

   PEER RESPONSE:
   
“Yes. Stuff like Amazon, right?”

My peer is aware of amazon using your data such as purchases to give you ads for their website.
