# Case Project 6-1: Survey about Privacy

**Survey**
1.	Do you know what location services are?
   RESPONSE FROM PEER:
“Tracking.”

The person I interviewed is aware of location services and how they are used. They didn't give me very descriptive and lengthy answer but "tracking" shows that they are aware that their device can be tracked using location services.

3.	What is RAID?
“RAID 0, RAID 1, RAID 10. Striping and mirroring.”

3.Are you aware of survaillence based advertisers?
“Yes.”
